        I am a college (B.Tech) student searching for my true passion within the wide and exhilerating world of Computer Science. I'm determined to grow from curious to capable. I prioritise clarity, empathy, and doing good work; not only for myself, but for those around me. I’m a problem-solver and a life-long learner, always looking for opportunities to contribute, adapt, and improve.

        Most would describe me as very <i>very</i> shy. However, I am someone you can <i>always</i> count on. I’m an inherently cheerful person with a positive outlook, and I’m always open to trying new experiences.
        <br>
        I work well in team settings. I’m the kind of teammate who makes sure deadlines are met, checklists are checked, and no one’s quietly drowning in tasks. I regularly check in with my teammates and am always willing to step in and support where needed. While I tend to be hesitant about taking on leadership roles, I really thrive as a dependable second-in-command.

        Coding-wise, I am confident in Python, C & working with SQL through sqlite3 and MySQL. I'm reasonably comfortable working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Git and GitHub. I am learning Java at the moment.

          It’s a vast and ever-evolving industry, and honestly, it can feel a bit overwhelming to navigate. But so far, I think I'm interested in Data Science, Database Management & Backend development. I would also like to explore Cloud Computing.  I like the idea of working behind the scenes to make systems efficient, reliable, and insightful- to help make the world go round, just as it always has. I want to be part of building and maintaining the invisible frameworks that keep everything running smoothly.
          <br>
          That said, I’m still in the process of discovering new areas and figuring out where my strengths and interests truly align - and I’m excited about the journey ahead.

        I aspire to give my best in everything I take on. Even if it's something I didn't choose, I believe in showing up fully and giving it my all. To me, doing your best isn't about perfection (after all perfect is the enemy of good) it's about being consistent, staying open to learning, and taking personal pride in the journey.

        I like to plan just enough to get started confidently, but I’m always ready to adapt when things inevitably deviate from the expectation. I start by thinking through the big picture, then break it down as I go.
