# Celia Victor's Personal Website 💻

Made in June 2025 to document & showcase my skills, projects & experiences.
This site isn’t just a portfolio, it was a personal project I thoroughly enjoyed making. I also used this oppertunity to experiment with code, design, and ideas.
Also made as as one of the submissions for Week 8 of CS50x.
